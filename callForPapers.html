<h1> Call for papers</h1>


<p>This Call for Papers expects two kinds of contributions.

  <!-- (pdf version of the call for paper available <a href="https://rrpr2024.sciencesconf.org/data/callForPapersRRPR24.pdf">here</a>) -->
       </p>
<p>The <strong>track 1 on RR Frameworks</strong> is dedicated to the <span>general topics of Reproducible Research in experimental Computer Science with clear links</span>&nbsp;to Image Processing and Pattern Recognition. Papers describing experiences, frameworks or platforms are welcome. The contributions might also include discussions on software libraries, experiences highlighting how the works benefit from Reproducible Research.</p>
<p>In the <strong>track 2 on RR Results</strong>, authors are invited to describe their works in terms of Reproducible Research. For example, authors of papers already accepted to ICPR might propose a companion paper describing the quality of the reproducible aspects. In particular the papers of this track can focus mainly (but not limited) for instance on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Algorithmic implementation details</li>
<li>Influence of parameter(s) for the result quality (criteria to optimize them).</li>
<li>Integration of source code in an other framework.</li>
<li>Known limitations (or difficult cases).</li>
<li>Future improvements.</li>
<li>Installation procedure.</li>
</ul>
<p>For this track, the topics could overlap with the main topics of the ICPR tracks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Geometry and Deep Learning</li>
<li>Discrete Geometry and Mathematical Morphology</li>
<li>Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning</li>
<li>Computer Vision and Robot Vision</li>
<li>Image, Speech, Signal, and Video Processing</li>
<li>Document Analysis, Biometrics, and Pattern Recognition Applications.</li>
<li>Biomedical Image Analysis and Applications</li>
</ul>
