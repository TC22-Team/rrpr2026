<h1> Workshop on Reproducible Research in Pattern Recognition</h1>



<h2> Presentation </h2>

<p>
Following the success of the five first éditions, we propose the 6th edition of the ICPR workshop on <b> Reproducible Research in Pattern Recognition</b>. 
</p>


<b>  RRPR 2026 </b> is intended as both a short participative course on the
  Reproducible Research (RR) aspects, leading to open discussions with
  the participants, and also as a practical workshop on how to
  actually perform RR. In addition, another key goal for gathering the
  research community is to further advance the scientific aspects of
  reproducibility in pattern recognition research.
</p>


<p>
  This workshop is of interest for all ICPR participants and attendees
  since it allows to handle various topics not restricted to one
  specific fields. The reproducibility is an important topics in
  general and particularly good for PhD students and young researchers
  to learn "good habits".
 </p>


<p> The workshop should follow an on-site and will study on the possibility to accept online presentations. </p>


<p>
  <b> Note:</b> RRPR 2026 will publish its own separate
  post-proceedings (springer LNCS, confirmation actually pending),
  distinct from the ICPR 2026 proceedings.
